# 📊 arketing Funnel & Conversion Drop-Off Analyzer

An end-to-end analytics system built to analyze ecommerce marketing funnel performance, identify drop-off points, and uncover conversion optimization opportunities.

This project demonstrates real-world funnel analytics, cohort retention modeling, and statistical experiment validation using production-style data architecture.

---

## 🚀 Project Objective

Businesses lose revenue due to inefficiencies across the marketing funnel.

This system helps answer:

- Where are users dropping off in the funnel?
- What is the true sequential conversion rate?
- Which product categories convert best?
- How strong is customer retention?
- Are A/B experiments statistically significant?

---
## 🔍 Core Funnel Flow

```

View → Cart → Purchase

```

The platform validates both:

- Standard funnel progression
- True sequential conversion logic
- Drop-off percentage at each stage

---


## 🏗 Architecture

```

Raw Event Data
↓
Data Cleaning
↓
Session-Level Funnel Engineering
↓
Category & Cohort Metrics
↓
Precomputed Summary Tables
↓
Streamlit Executive Dashboard

```

Heavy computation is separated from the dashboard layer to ensure sub-second load performance.
